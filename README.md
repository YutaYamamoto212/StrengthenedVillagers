# StrengthenedVillagers
The idea comes from Vindication Villager Addon, but you can strengthen villagers by giving them some weapons instead of just iron axes. Due to the addition of pillagers and raids from the Village and Pillage update, the Vindication Villager Addon appears to be obsolete in order for raids to trigger and work properly. Additionally, strengthened villagers will spawn naturally.
